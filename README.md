  <h1><u>JavaScript Functions</u></h1>
  <h2>To make our lives easier I have made a few functions that you are welcome to copy and paste into your own projects.</h2>
  <h2>These functions are maliable and not only save you time but are a good example of how knowing a little javascript can go a long way.</h2>
  <h2>Think of them as tools in a Utility Belt and apply them at the start of your project and use them as often as you like.</h2>
